Pivot Table Reports: Created comprehensive Pivot Table reports and applied conditional formatting to enhance data visualization and interpretation.
Domain Knowledge: Gained valuable expertise in the Sales and Finance domains, understanding the intricacies and metrics critical to these areas.
Analytical Mindset: Developed strong problem-solving and analytical skills, enabling me to tackle complex data challenges effectively.
